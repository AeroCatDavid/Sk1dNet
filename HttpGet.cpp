Hello chief. I guess you found my github. If your name is 'superskater' then please leave lmao.

This Httpget is for c++ and it works on Axon. It is very simple and i take all credits.
I havent tested it yet but i trust myself. You need DownloadURL thing for c++ or else it wont be able to download the script!


if(Script == std::string("HttpGet")) {
        std::string shit;
        std::string httpscript;
        shit = "loadstring(game:HttpGet(('";
        shit += httpscript;
        shit += "'),true))()";

         std::string FinalScriptHttpGet = DownloadURL(httpscript);
         ExecuteScript(FinalScriptHttpGet);
    }
    
    
    I had some issues on this because i don't know if the *if(Script == std::string("HttpGet")) {* part will work. 
    But you try it fam. All for you <3
    
    I bet all Axon exploits will have HttpGet now lol.
